============================================================================================

Area Communication Pages
------------------------
-Main Feature Along With 

Community Spots (connected with area communication pages)
---------------------------------------------------------
-pre-determined locations allow users to communicate and meet up with fellow commuters in spots that do not compromise sensitive information such as a their actual address if they do not wish to disclose this.


Message Boards
--------------
-offer community and commuter bonding
-good place to meet people when you are a commuter

Calendar Support
----------------
-I don't think this will be as big of a feature as teh other ones which seem more important to me.
-would allow users to schedule events and invite other users to these events
-can already be done through google calendars with our @ashland.edu emails, so this might be redundant
-might get cut from the app if there is not enough time, or effect that can be spared to develop

Users and User Profiles
-----------------------
-Google Sign In
-some way to verify that the accounts are actually the people they are saying they are ( perhaps limit this to .edu emails initially or something)
-allows users to get to know the people they are going to be ride sharing with
-protect user information
-allow user to display only the information they wish to show

Security and Liabilities
------------------------
-need to protect user information very securely
-need to worry about user's safety when meeting up with people you don't actually know
-perpaps post warnings establishing that people should be careful about who they are meeting with, and to make sure that they are actually who they say they are
